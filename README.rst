CLAIM - Common Lisp AIM Interface
=================================

file.


INTRODUCTION
------------

CLAIM is an implementation of AOL's semi-open Instant Messaging
protocol, TOC (see PROTOCOL.txt).  It allows one to build chatbots and
other AIM clients.

QUICKSTART
----------

Load this code (with ASDF, ``(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :claim)``
should be sufficient once you've put the directory containing the
claim.asd file in ``asdf:*central-registry*``), then load the
``examples/gossip-bot.lisp`` file.  At the listener, run the
start-gossip-bot function::

  ? (start-gossip-bot "myusername" "mypassword")

You must use the username and password of an existing AIM account (see
http://aim.aol.com/ on how to create a free AIM account).

Anyone can now send messages to and interact with the gossip bot.

REQUIREMENTS & DEPENDENCIES
---------------------------

CLAIM requires minimal TCP socket support.  The file ``sysdeps.lisp``
contains a single function definition, ``MAKE-TCP-SOCKET``, that opens
a TCP socket.  Implementations are provided for OpenMCL, ACL,
LispWorks and SBCL.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
--------------------

The TOC protcol is slightly binary, mostly text.  Accordingly, I open
socket streams in text mode and fake the binary parts.  It won't work
unless your Lisp's code-char and char-code functions use ASCII or some
ASCII supersets.

I've written the code without assuming multiprocessing, but in a way
that should be easily integrated with most multiprocessing
implementations.  Let me know if it doesn't work out that way.

I checked all the other AIM libraries I could find, and nobody even
tries to deal with the "server speed limit", which was a constant
problem for me.  See the comments at the end of ``claim.lisp`` for one
attempt to solve this problem.

The following implementations of TOC were helpful when writing this
one:

* http://sourceforge.net/projects/tnt/
* http://www.wiredfool.com/ftoc/ (Eric Soroos)

This code has been tested in ACL, OpenMCL, SBCL and LispWorks.

BUGS
----

There should be much more documentation.  I've tried to structure the
code so that it is easy to extend and use for chat clients, but
documenting what I did would help a lot too.  Sorry.

The gossip bot should do some HTML parsing if it wants to work
perfectly with iChat; When the bot sends "Someone said you smell",
iChat shows "you smell".
